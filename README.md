# Liar's Lingo

This game is an adaptation of [Wordle](https://powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/),
which is similar to the American game show Lingo, which ran from 1987 to 1988.
This version makes the following change: after each round, one of the hints
is changed to a different color.

Liar's Lingo was created by David Radcliffe (dradcliffe@gmail.com), and it was
remixed from Worble (https://glitch.com/~worble).
